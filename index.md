{% comment %}
SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
intend to teach.
4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.

SETUP

Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3>DB Browser for SQLite</h3>
<p>
You will need to install <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a> to complete these lessons. DB Browser for SQLite provides a graphical user interface for connecting to and interacting with a SQLite database. This application bundles SQLite, so you won’t need to install SQLite separately. <br />

Note: on Windows, the PortableApp download is recommended as the regular version may take a long time to install on certain systems.
</p>
<h3>Download the data</h3>
<p>
To import data, you’ll need to open DB Browser for SQLite and download a zip file containing the data files for this tutorial.<br />

1. Download the data files doaj-article-sample.zip from <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2822005">Zenodo</a>.<br />
2. Open the zip file with the zip utlity on your machine and save the folder and files to a location where you can easily find them. For example, your Desktop.<br />
3. Contained in the zip file are two files, doaj-article-sample.db and doaj-article-sample.db.sql. You can either open the database file (less steps) or import the SQL file (more steps). <br />
  
<b>You can find detailed instruction on the <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-sql/index.html#db-browser-for-sqlite">SQL Setup Page</a>.</b>
